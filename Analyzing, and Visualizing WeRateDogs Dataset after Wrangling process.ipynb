    "You've no doubt heard of [We Rate Dogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) by now. Either you follow the account on Twitter, or you've read about the [\"They're good dogs Brent\"](http://www.collegehumor.com/post/7043774/the-theyre-good-dogs-brent-saga-is-complete) story, which took the Internet by storm in 2016.\n",

    "In case you didn't WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media coverage both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of two years, creator and curator Matt Nelson has built an empire out of being the internet’s go-to dog-rater. Nelson bestows rarely high ratings — on a 1-to-10 scale, almost all of his ratings are higher than 10 — on user-submitted pups, along with witty, ironic captions that are cute, hilarious, and relatable all at once.\n",
