    "Data wrangling is a core skill that everyone who works with data should be familiar with since so much of the world's data isn't clean. We need to wrangle our data for good outcomes, otherwise there could be consequences. If we analyze, visualize, or model our data before we wrangle it, our consequences could be making mistakes, missing out on cool insights, and wasting time. **So best practices say wrangle. Always.**\n",

    "- Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (i.e. \"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data we will find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, we will query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then we will read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count.\n",
